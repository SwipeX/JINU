# JINU

**Java - Input Native Utility**

_Native Mouse + Key Listeners, with according response framework._

- Simple, and works as intended. Currently mouse responses are not set up.
- Essentially the base framework to work with native events on any OS.
- Response framework provides utility support of the `java.awt.Robot` api.
